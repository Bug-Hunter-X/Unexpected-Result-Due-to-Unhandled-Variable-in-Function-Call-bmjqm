# Unexpected Result Due to Unhandled Variable in Function Call

This repository demonstrates a common JavaScript bug caused by an unhandled variable in a function call.

## Bug Description

2. Run `node bug.js`.
3. Observe the unexpected output.

## Bug Solution

The solution involves ensuring that the variable `result1` is correctly passed as an argument to the `bar` function.  See `bugSolution.js` for a corrected version.
